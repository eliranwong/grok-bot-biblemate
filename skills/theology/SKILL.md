## Grok Bot runtime notes (native port)

This skill was ported from the BibleMate Grok Build `.grok` playbook for **native Grok Bot** execution.

### Tool mapping
| Playbook concept | Use on Grok Bot |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Web research | `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` |
| Read files | `Read` |
| Shell / scripts | `Shell` (`python3` on helpers beside this playbook under `/home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/`) |
| Parallel workers | `Task` with `subagent_type: executor` (or MessageSubagent to steer) |
| Save reports | Write the **full, uncompromised** report under `/workspace/grok-bot-biblemate/` in the folders the playbook names (`biblemate/`, `devotions/`, `sermons/`, `studies/`, …) |
| User-visible result | Always `SendToUser` a short digest **and** a chat copy of the report (paste full text or attach the saved `.md`) + concrete path when finished |

### Rules
- Do **not** shell out to `grok`/`claude`/`agy` for this skill — execute the methodology yourself with the tools above.
- **Never invent Scripture text.** Fetch verses via the `bible` skill / `bible_retriever.py` (local SQLite under `/workspace/biblemate/data/bibles` and `/workspace/biblemate/data_custom/bibles`; also mirrored at `/home/box/biblemate/...`).
- Default translations when unspecified: **CSB** (English), **CUV** (Chinese). Prefer Cantonese (粵語) for devotionals/check-ins when the user's language preference suggests it.
- Adopt a warm pastoral tone (Compassionate Pastor / related personas from BibleMate agents.md) unless the skill names a different persona.
- Prefer parallel tool calls where the playbook says to run work together.
- Working directory for artifacts: `/workspace/grok-bot-biblemate` (report folders sync to git — do not treat as disposable cache).
- On every finished run: full report on disk **and** chat copy via `SendToUser` (attach `.md` for long reports).
- When the playbook mentions sibling skills, read the full playbook under `/home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/<id>/SKILL.md` (catalog loaders under `/home/box/agent-data/workflows/` point there after install).
- Helper scripts live beside the playbook after install, e.g. `python3 /home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/bible/bible_retriever.py "<query>"`.

# Theology Skill

## Overview
This standalone skill enables any agent to perform a high-quality theology study for a given Bible reference, text, or topic.

## Guidelines & Objectives
When executing this skill:
- Keep explanations biblically accurate and structurally clear.
- Cite specific book, chapter, and verse references for all statements.
- Ensure that the output is comprehensive, addressing all prompt criteria without skipping sections.
- Focus strictly on the requirements of this specific study type.

## Instructions
Study the theological, doctrinal, and spiritual themes of a passage:
1. **Doctrinal Mapping**: Trace systematic doctrines (Theology Proper, Bibliology, Christology, Pneumatology, Anthropology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Eschatology).
2. **Biblical Theology Integration**: Connect the passage to the covenantal progression of God's redemptive plan.

## Slash command guidance

Folded from the Grok Build command `/theology` — treat “user arguments after the slash command” as the input the user provided after the slash.

Adopt the **Biblical Theologian** persona from `/workspace/biblemate-agentic-workspace/.grok/agents.md`.

Please write the theological messages conveyed in the content given below, in reference to the Bible.
In addition, explain the significance of the theological messages in the bible.
I want your writing to be comprehensive and informative.
Remember, in your writing, please provide me with concrete examples from the Bible and the bible references from the text you are citing.
