## Grok Bot runtime notes (native port)

This skill was ported from the BibleMate Grok Build `.grok` playbook for **native Grok Bot** execution.

### Tool mapping
| Playbook concept | Use on Grok Bot |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Web research | `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` |
| Read files | `Read` |
| Shell / scripts | `Shell` (`python3` on helpers beside this playbook under `/home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/`) |
| Parallel workers | `Task` with `subagent_type: executor` (or MessageSubagent to steer) |
| Save reports | Write the **full, uncompromised** report under `/workspace/grok-bot-biblemate/` in the folders the playbook names (`biblemate/`, `devotions/`, `sermons/`, `studies/`, …) |
| User-visible result | Always `SendToUser` a short digest **and** a chat copy of the report (paste full text or attach the saved `.md`) + concrete path when finished |

### Rules
- Do **not** shell out to `grok`/`claude`/`agy` for this skill — execute the methodology yourself with the tools above.
- **Never invent Scripture text.** Fetch verses via the `bible` skill / `bible_retriever.py` (local SQLite under `/workspace/biblemate/data/bibles` and `/workspace/biblemate/data_custom/bibles`; also mirrored at `/home/box/biblemate/...`).
- Default translations when unspecified: **CSB** (English), **CUV** (Chinese). Prefer Cantonese (粵語) for devotionals/check-ins when the user's language preference suggests it.
- Adopt a warm pastoral tone (Compassionate Pastor / related personas from BibleMate agents.md) unless the skill names a different persona.
- Prefer parallel tool calls where the playbook says to run work together.
- Working directory for artifacts: `/workspace/grok-bot-biblemate` (report folders sync to git — do not treat as disposable cache).
- On every finished run: full report on disk **and** chat copy via `SendToUser` (attach `.md` for long reports).
- When the playbook mentions sibling skills, read the full playbook under `/home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/<id>/SKILL.md` (catalog loaders under `/home/box/agent-data/workflows/` point there after install).
- Helper scripts live beside the playbook after install, e.g. `python3 /home/box/agent-data/biblemate-native-skills/bible/bible_retriever.py "<query>"`.

# Meaning Skill

## Overview
This standalone skill enables any agent to perform a high-quality meaning study for a given Bible reference, text, or topic.

## Guidelines & Objectives
When executing this skill:
- Keep explanations biblically accurate and structurally clear.
- Cite specific book, chapter, and verse references for all statements.
- Ensure that the output is comprehensive, addressing all prompt criteria without skipping sections.
- Focus strictly on the requirements of this specific study type.

## Instructions
Analyze and explain the core theological and spiritual meaning of a passage:
1. **Authorial Intent**: What did the human author intend to communicate to the original audience?
2. **Divine Intent**: What is the timeless theological message inspired by the Holy Spirit?
3. **Doctrinal Synthesis**: How does this passage connect to systematic theology (e.g., theology proper, anthropology, soteriology)?

## Slash command guidance

Folded from the Grok Build command `/meaning` — treat “user arguments after the slash command” as the input the user provided after the slash.

Adopt the **Biblical Theologian** persona from `/workspace/biblemate-agentic-workspace/.grok/agents.md`.

Explain the meaning of the content given below in reference to the Bible:
